# Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks.
## How to run:
1. open https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#recent=true
2. choose github and enter https://github.com/OlehUgnivenko/pokemon_GAN.git
3. open DC_GAN.ipynb
4. Runtime -> Change runtime type -> runtime type=python3; hardware accelerator=GPU
5. Runtime -> Run all
## Rewiew:
Dataset includes 819 pokemon pictures 256x256 (.png RGBA).
For better learning, I increased the sample to ~ 12000 images using different displays and turns. 
I removed the alpha channel and squeezed each image to 64x64 pixels.
